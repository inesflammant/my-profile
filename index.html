            <h1>Hello there, I'm Inès</h1>
            <img src="profilepicture.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="Inès Flammant">
            <p id="introduction"> I'm a student at ESSEC Business School, and soon I will be studying at Emory University, as an exchange student.<br> 
            I took many relevant courses during these last semesters, but I have to say that I am really enjoying coding ! </p>
            <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/fr" target="_blank" id="btn-pattern">Learn to code too</a>

            <h2>Luxury</h2>
            <p>I was an intern as a sales advisor for a famous French luxury house. Now, I am following courses on how to manage luxury brands, applying what I learned "on the field". <br>  
            I hope to work in this industry someday, and have an impact on the environment, as I am convinced that the luxury industry can be more responsible and sustainable.</p>

            <h2>Traveling</h2>
            <p>I love French culture, but I want to see more of the world. Because of covid, many opportunities have been cancelled for me, and I didn't get to travel as much as I wanted. I hope to be able to do my next internship abroad !</p>  
        </div>
        <div class="div-smaller">
            <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>I have always loved drawing and painting, but I don't have as much time as I used to. That's why I always search for courses that involve some kind of creative liberty. Like marketing, communications, or coding !</p>
